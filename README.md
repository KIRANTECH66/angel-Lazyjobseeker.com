🗣 Testimonials
	•	“I used Angel for three back-to-back interviews on Google Meet. The tool stayed invisible while giving me quick hints and code snippets. The lifetime plan paid for itself in a week.” — Aarav Sharma, SDE (Bengaluru)
	•	“Structured coding answers are actually structured — not vague. I get complexity notes, edge cases, and test examples. That level of detail saved me in a system design round.” — Rohit Verma, Full-Stack Dev (Pune)
	•	“Nothing is locked behind subscriptions. You buy once, bring an API key, and that’s it.” — Emily Johnson, Frontend Dev (Austin)
